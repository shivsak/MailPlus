CIOAPIClient is an easy to use iOS and OS X library for communicating with the Context.IO 2.0 API. It is built upon [NSURLSession](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/Foundation/Reference/NSURLSession_class/index.html) and provides convenient asynchronous block based methods for interacting with the API.

## Getting Started

* Sign up for a developer account at [Context.IO](http://context.io)
* [Submit a request](http://support.context.io/hc/en-us/requests/new) for a 3-legged OAuth Token. This library only supports 3-legged tokens to ensure end-users of your application can only access their own account
* [Download CIOAPIClient](https://github.com/contextio/contextio-ios) and check out the included iOS example app. It is also available as a [CocoaPod](http://cocoapods.org/) to make it even easier to add to your project
* View the full [Context.IO API documentation](http://context.io/docs/2.0) to better familiarize yourself with the API

## Using [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org)

To use `CIOAPIClient` in your project:

* If you don't have a podfile, run `pod init` to create one
* Add the following to your `Podfile`:<br>

```ruby
pod 'CIOAPIClient', '~> 0.9'
```

* Run `pod install` to install `CIOAPIClient` and its dependencies, then make sure to open the `.xcworkspace` file instead of `.xcodeproj` if you weren't using it already

[podfile]: https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/the-podfile.html

## Building the Example App

After cloning the git repository, make sure to install cocoapods used by the example app:

* `cd <repository path>/Example`
* `pod install`
* `open "Context.IO iOS Example App.xcworkspace"`

To run the example application, you will need to insert your Context.IO consumer key and secret in `CIOAppDelegate.m`.

## Exploring the API in a Playground

There is a pre-configured Xcode Playground (currently targeting Xcode 6.4 + Swift 1.2) in the `CIOPlayground` directory. Playgrounds with library dependencies are slightly finicky with Xcode 6.4, follow these steps to get it working:

* `cd CIOPlayground `
* `pod install`
* Open `CIOPlayground.xcworkspace`
* Select the `CIOAPIClient` Scheme in the Xcode scheme selection dropdown (it should have a dynamic framework yellow toolbox icon)
* Build the scheme (âŒ˜B)
* Select `CIOPlayground.playground` from the `CIOPlayground` project in the Project navigator left sidebar
* Add your consumer key and consumer secret to the line
```swift
let s: CIOAPISession = CIOAPISession(consumerKey: "", consumerSecret: "")
```
* At this point the playground will execute and an authentication WebView will appear in the bottom left corner of your screen
* Authorize an email account using the Context.IO auth flow in the WebView
    - The first time the code executes after authentication it may fail. Edit the playground to try again.
* Add any code you wish to try to the `authenticator.withAuthentication() { session in` block in the playground

## Example Usage

Use `CIOAPISession` to construct and execute signed [`NSURLRequests`][nsurl] against the Context.IO API.

[nsurl]: https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/Cocoa/Reference/Foundation/Classes/NSURLRequest_Class/index.html

### Beginning an API Session

Initialize `CIOAPISession` with your API key consumer key and consumer secret:

``` objective-c
CIOAPISession *session = [[CIOAPISession alloc] initWithConsumerKey:@"your-consumer-key"
                                                     consumerSecret:@"your-consumer-secret"];
```

### Authentication

`CIOAPISession` uses [Connect Tokens][ct] to authorize individual user's email accounts. Please see the example application for an overview of the authentication process. Feel free to re-use or subclass [`CIOAuthViewController`][cioauth] in your own project - it takes care of the details of authentication and should work out of the box for most purposes.

[cioauth]: https://github.com/contextio/contextio-ios/blob/master/Example/Classes/Controllers/CIOAuthViewController.m
[ct]: https://context.io/docs/2.0/connect_tokens

### [Retrieve Messages](https://context.io/docs/2.0/accounts/messages)

``` objective-c
[[session getMessagesWithParams:nil]
 executeWithSuccess:^(NSArray *responseArray) {
     self.messagesArray = responseArray;
 } failure:^(NSError *error) {
     NSLog(@"error getting messages: %@", error);
 }];
```

### [Add a Message to an Existing Folder/Label](https://context.io/docs/2.0/accounts/messages/folders)

``` objective-c
[[session updateFoldersForMessageWithID:message[@"message_id"]
                                 params:@{@"add": @"Test Label"}]
 executeWithSuccess:^(NSDictionary *response) {
     NSLog(@"Response: %@", response);
 } failure:^(NSError *error) {
     NSLog(@"error moving message: %@", error);
 }];
```

### [List Folders/Labels For An Account](https://context.io/docs/2.0/accounts/sources/folders#get)
```objective-c
// 0 is an alias for the first source of an account
[[session getFoldersForSourceWithLabel:@"0" params:nil]
 executeWithSuccess:^void(NSArray *folders) {
     NSLog(@"Folders: %@", folders);
 } failure:^void(NSError *error) {
     NSLog(@"Error getting folders: %@", error);
 }];
```

### [Download A Message Attachment](https://context.io/docs/2.0/accounts/files/content)

``` objective-c
NSDictionary *file = [message[@"files"] firstObject];
CIODownloadRequest *downloadRequest = [session downloadContentsOfFileWithID:file[@"file_id"]];
// Save file with attachment's filename in NSDocumentDirectory
NSURL *documentsURL = [[[NSFileManager defaultManager] URLsForDirectory:NSDocumentDirectory
                                                              inDomains:NSUserDomainMask] lastObject];
NSURL *fileURL = [documentsURL URLByAppendingPathComponent:file[@"file_name"]];
[session downloadRequest:downloadRequest
               toFileURL:fileURL
                 success:^{
                     NSLog(@"File downloaded: %@", [fileURL path]);
                 }
                 failure:^(NSError *error) {
                     NSLog(@"Download error: %@", error);
                 }
                progress:^(int64_t bytesRead, int64_t totalBytesRead, int64_t totalBytesExpected){
                    NSLog(@"Download progress: %0.2f%%",
                          ((double)totalBytesExpected / (double)totalBytesRead) * 100);
                }];

```
